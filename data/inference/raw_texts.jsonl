{"id": "REG_20776572", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nRepublic Act (RA) No. 9711, otherwise known as the \u201cFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Act of 2009,\u201d and its Implementing Rules and Regulations has declared the policy of the state to adopt, support, establish, institutionalize, improve and maintain structures, processes, mechanism and initiatives that are aimed, directed and designed to: (a) protect and promote the right to health of the Filipino people; (b) help establish and maintain an effective health products regulatory system; and (c) undertake appropriate manpower development and research responsive to the country\u2019s health needs and problems.\nIn 2020, the FDA worked on a streamlined regulation for the conduct of clinical trials in the Philippines. This effort resulted in the publication of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0010, entitled \u201cRegulations on the Conduct of Clinical Trials for Investigational Products,\u201d approved on 06 March 2020 and implemented on 06 August 2020.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) supports the implementation of reliance on other regulators\u2019 work as a general principle in order to make the best use of available resources and expertise (WHO Technical Report Series, No.1033, 2021 (Annex 10, Good reliance practices in the regulation of medical products: high level principles and considerations)1. This principle enables leveraging the output of other regulatory agencies whenever possible while placing a greater focus at the national level on value-added regulatory activities that cannot be undertaken by other authorities, such as in-country vigilance and clinical trial activities. Reliance approaches can facilitate timely access to safe, effective, and quality-assured drug products and can help in regulatory preparedness and response, particularly during public health emergencies.\nGood Reliance Practices1 are anchored in the overarching Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) which provide a means for establishing sound, affordable and effective regulation of medical products as an important part of health system strengthening. Effective implementation of GRP can lead to consistent regulatory processes, sound regulatory decision-making, increased efficiency of regulatory systems and better public health outcomes.\n\nII. OBJECTIVE\nThis Circular provides guidelines on reliance for approval of clinical trial applications and to promote a more efficient and effective approach to the regulations in the oversight of the conduct of clinical trials in the Philippines. Specifically, this Circular aims to:\nA. To facilitate the evaluation of clinical trial applications through regulatory reliance; and\nB. To improve the access of investigational drug products for public health emergencies, rare diseases, and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health threats.\n\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\nThis Circular shall apply to Sponsors, Contract Research Organizations (CRO), investigators and Research Ethics Committees (RECs) involved in the approval, conduct, monitoring and inspection, in all phases of Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCTs) for investigational drug products addressing public health emergencies, rare diseases, and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health threats intended for eventual product registration and marketing.\n\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\nTo ensure a common understanding of concepts and clarity in the interpretation of the terms used in this Circular, the definitions listed in this section are from AO No. 2020-00102, International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines (E6 & E17)3,4, and/or modified from the WHO Technical Report Series, No.1033, 20211.\nA. Abridged Regulatory Pathway refers to regulatory procedures facilitated by reliance, whereby the regulatory decision is solely or partially based on the application of reliance.

{"id": "REG_20776568", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. RATIONALE\nPesticide registration involves an evaluation of comprehensive scientific data demonstrating that a pesticide is effective for its intended purposes and does not pose an unacceptable risk to human or animal health or the environment. In particular, the aspect of pesticide registration which reviews the effectiveness of a pesticide is the technical evaluation of the submitted bio-efficacy study. Following Department of Health (DOH) Administrative Order (AO) No. 2019-0008, entitled, \u201cNew Rules and Regulations in the Registration of Household Pesticide Products and their Active Ingredients\u201d, accepted protocols have been identified and that any deviation from standard protocols require sufficient and compelling justification to ensure soundness of the method and the reliability to produce data to support product claims.\nIn the course of the implementation of the said AO, updates on the internationally-accepted standards suggest that changes in the list of accepted protocols must be made. Additionally, an assessment of the implementation of the AO showed that pesticide registration applications were found to display deficiencies in the submitted bio-efficacy test study which resulted in disapproved applications.

{"id": "REG_20776560", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nIn 2005, the ASEAN Cosmetic Directive (ACD), its annexes and appendices, were adopted and implemented through the issuance of Department of Health (DOH) Administrative Orders (AO) No. 2005-0015 and 2005-0025, respectively, to harmonize the cosmetic regulatory scheme in the ASEAN region. The harmonization scheme aims to eliminate restrictions to trade of cosmetic products and enhance cooperation within the ASEAN Member States (AMS) in ensuring the safety, quality and claimed benefits of cosmetic products. The processes instituted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through the Center for Cosmetics and Household/Urban Hazardous Substances Regulation and Research (CCHUHSRR), pursuant to the adoption of the ACD, therein included pre- and post-marketing regulatory processes, such as the notification of cosmetic products and the audit of Product Information Files (PIF), among others. Under the ACD, ASEAN Member States (AMS), through the National Regulatory Authorities (NRA), shall conduct post-marketing surveillance (PMS) activities, and undertake all necessary measures to ensure that only cosmetic products that conform to the provisions of the ACD, its Annexes and Appendices may be placed in the market.\nTo further enhance the efficiency of the notification application process and promote transparency of information, in 2015, through FDA Memorandum Circular (FMC) No. 2015-011, CCHUHSRR digitized and implemented the Cosmetic Electronic Notification process using the FDA E-Portal. With the entry of cosmetic products facilitated by the implementation of the electronic notification, the FDA reiterated the responsibilities of the Market Authorization Holder (MAH), pursuant to the ACD, including the maintenance of a Product Information File (PIF). Wherein, the PIF is intended to contain evidence that should be sufficient to review safety, quality and claimed benefits of cosmetic products, it is incumbent upon the MAH to ensure the accessibility and availability of such documents for the review and audit of the FDA. To assist MAHs, the FDA issued FDA Circular No. 2018-001 and FDA Advisory No. 2022-0383 providing guidance on the PIF requirement.\nHowever, in the course of the implementation of the ACD and PIF Audits, findings of the FDA showed that a number of MAHs remain to be non-compliant to the PIF requirement. Violations were found to range from an incomplete PIF to completely without PIF for cosmetic products already placed in the market. There is thus a need to strengthen the implementation and enforcement of the ACD with the end-view of ensuring the safety and quality of cosmetic products. It is in this light that these updated PIF guidelines are hereby issued, which is intended to form part of the FDA PMS framework complementing the cosmetic electronic notification scheme. Further, wherein the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced mobility restrictions that posed challenges in the conduct of PIF Audits, alternative audit arrangements and other sustainable mechanisms have been considered in the design of the PIF Audit.\nIIOBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to:\n\nImprove the regulatory compliance to PIF requirements as set forth by the ACD; and\nEstablish an updated PIF guidelines in the context of evolving digital technology and pandemic resiliency.\n\nIII. SCOPE\n\nThis Circular shall cover all cosmetic establishments duly licensed by the CCHUHSRR who are holders of a valid Certificate of Product Notification (CPN).\nIV. GENERAL GUIDELINES\nA. Only duly notified cosmetic products that conform to the provisions of the ACD, its Annexes and Appendices, shall be placed in the market. Cosmetic products that are duly notified with the FDA shall have a corresponding PIF.\nB. The PIF of a Cosmetic Product must be made readily available and accessible to the FDA by the MAH upon the issuance of a Certificate of Product Notification (CPN). The PIF shall be kept, updated and maintained by the MAH in accordance with the language, format, retention period, among others, as provided in these Guidelines.\nC. Cosmetic products duly notified with the FDA shall be subjected to a PIF Audit. The FDA may perform PIF audits as part of routine inspections and audits or in an ad hoc manner, and may be conducted on-site or off-site. The MAH, through its Qualified Person, shall coordinate with the FDA to ensure the orderly conduct of the PIF Audit.\nD. The FDA shall ensure the confidentiality of the data and information submitted or presented during the PIF Audit.\nE. Failure to comply with these guidelines, including but not limited to, deficiencies in the PIF content and format, non-submission of documentation necessary to determine the safety, quality, and claimed benefit of a cosmetic product, refusal of the MAH and/or Qualified Person to coordinate with the FDA thereby preventing the orderly conduct of the PIF Audit, shall be subject to appropriate regulatory action.\nF. The FDA shall not be precluded from conducting other PMS activities, apart from PIF Audits, to assess the safety, quality, and claimed benefit of cosmetic products and determine compliance with the ACD and other relevant product standards, in order to ensure consumer protection and public health and safety, pursuant to its mandate following Republic Act (RA) No. 7394, RA 9711, and other laws, rules and regulations.\nV. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES\nA. Responsibilities of the MAH. The MAH shall have the following responsibilities in relation to the PIF requirement:\n\nThe MAH or the \u201ccompany responsible for placing the cosmetic product in the market\u201d shall keep and maintain an updated PIF.\nThe MAH shall be updated on the latest amendments of the ACD, its Annexes and Appendices. The MAH shall preferably keep a file of all relevant FDA issuances, rules, regulations and standards for cosmetic products.\nThe MAH shall ensure that the complete PIF is readily available and accessible at the address of the MAH as declared in the CPN consistent with the address indicated on the immediate or secondary packaging of the cosmetic product as per ACD Appendix II \u2013 ASEAN Cosmetic Labeling Requirements. For Distributors and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), considerations shall be given as to the completeness of the PIF, wherein Part I of the PIF shall be required, at the minimum, to be available at the address of the MAH for the purposes of initial PIF Audits.\nFor PIF Audits, accessibility and availability of information to the FDA shall be ensured by the MAH. Further, upon specific request of the FDA, other information required to determine the safety, quality, and claimed benefit of the cosmetic product shall be provided by the MAH within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nB. Language, Content and Format of PIF. The PIF shall be in accordance with the following language, content and format:\n\nThe PIF documents shall be written in English and/or Filipino Language.\nThe PIF shall contain administrative information pertaining to the status of authorizations of the cosmetic product, its manufacturer and MAH, and technical information pertaining to the quality and safety data of the raw materials and finished product, following the content and format of the ANNEX A.\nThe PIF shall be kept in any suitable media type (i.e., paper, electronic, etc.) provided that it is easily accessible to the PIF Auditor.\n\nC. Retention Period and Updating of PIF. The retention period and updating of the PIF shall be in accordance with the following:\n\nThe PIF shall be kept and maintained on a per product basis.\nThe PIF shall be kept for a minimum of three (3) years after the cosmetic product has last been placed in the market (i.e., date when the inventory reaches zero (0) at retail level) or according to the company\u2019s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), whichever provides for a longer retention period.\n\nD. Conduct of PIF Audits. PIF Audits shall be performed by the FDA in accordance with the Audit Plan and/or other Notices issued by the FDA in order to determine and ensure the compliance of the products with the ACD, following these guidelines:\nTypes of PIF Audit. PIF Audits may be conducted according to the following classifications:\n\na. Routine PIF Audit \u2013 are audits conducted by FDA during the validity of the CPN, which occurs following a Notice of Audit (NOA) sent preferably one (1) month before the date of Audit.\nb. Ad hoc PIF Audit \u2013 audits which are conducted with or without notice, triggered by any of the following events:\n\n\n\nresults from sampling, testing, and verifying products from the market,\nconsumer complaints,\nadverse event reports from healthcare practitioners and other verifiable sources,\nevaluation of ingredients, formulation, intended use and/or product claims during notification application,\npost-licensing inspections, monitoring, and investigations,\nadvertisements and promotional articles monitoring,\npost-marketing surveillance (PMS) activities,\ncoordination with local enforcement agencies, government agencies, and international partners, and\nother assessments, reviews, and/or investigations initiated or referred to the FDA which finds that a cosmetic product has issues relating to safety, quality, and/or claimed benefits which necessitate FDA intervention.\n\n\n\n2. Sites of PIF Audit. PIF Audits, whether routine or ad hoc, may be conducted on-site or off-site based on the urgency of the issue being investigated and the best use of resources available.\na. On-site audits \u2013 are audits where the PIF Auditors are physically at the address of the MAH, as declared in the CPN.\nb. Off-site audits \u2013 are audits where the PIF is audited remotely by the PIF Auditor. Off-site audits may occur in any of the following manner as determined by the FDA:\ni. Synchronous remote PIF Audit \u2013 are audits performed off-site, where documents are presented by the MAH to the PIF Auditor, and reviewed, through a live audit session assisted by information and communication technology platforms.\nii. Desktop PIF Audit \u2013 are audits performed remotely by reviewing the required documents submitted by the MAH.\n\nThe conduct of off-site audits shall take into consideration the following:\ni. Synchronous remote PIF audits shall utilize secure virtual meeting/conferencing platforms hosted by the FDA. Virtual meetings shall be documented and/or recorded. Recordings shall only be used for the purposes of accurately documenting the conduct of the PIF Audit meeting, including the agreements made therein.\nii. The PIF and the specific documents requested for review shall be transmitted to the PIF Auditor through a secure file-sharing platform, either hosted by the FDA or the MAH, at the preference of the MAH. All documents transmitted to the FDA shall be treated with utmost confidentiality and shall be used for the purposes of the audit and the regulatory actions that follow.\niii. Findings that cannot be verified remotely shall be verified on-site, if necessary.\niv. Collection of samples, if necessary, shall be coordinated with the establishment.\n\nNotice of Audit. Except for cases involving emergency investigations or on issues that require urgent resolution, the FDA shall issue a Notice of Audit (NOA) to the MAH prior the conduct of a PIF Audit. The NOA shall specify the date, type and site of the audit. In case of off-site audits, the pertinent details for the arrangements of the remote or desktop audit shall also be provided. Should the MAH require special arrangements, such must be communicated by the MAH to the FDA once they have received a copy of the NOA.\n\nCommunication with the establishment shall be done using the contact details provided in the notification application. Should the MAH fail to respond within the prescribed period indicated in the Notice of Audit, the FDA will undertake regulatory actions, including the issuance of a Warning Letter.\n\nDocuments and other materials to be presented during PIF Audits. The following PIF documents and other materials must be made available to the FDA to ensure the orderly and timely conduct of the PIF Audit:\n\na. In general, the complete PIF must be made available during PIF Audits, whether routine or ad hoc, onsite or offsite. However, the following considerations may be applied by the FDA, as deemed necessary.\ni. In all cases, MAHs scheduled for a PIF Audit shall be required to present Part I \u201cAdministrative Documents and Product Summary\u201d of the PIF, aside from the required documents specified in the Notice.\nii. For distributors and MSMEs, considerations may be applied for Parts II to IV of the PIF, provided that a reasonable and compelling justification is provided for the absent PIF Parts. The MAH may thus be given a sufficient amount of time ranging from fifteen to sixty (15-60) calendar days, depending on the urgency of the audit, to make the necessary arrangements with their suppliers and submit the required documents and/or pertinent information.\niii. Product Information/documents containing confidential materials and/or proprietary information that have been required by the FDA representatives during audit may be directly sent to the agency by the foreign supplier or local manufacturer or source.\nb. For ad hoc audits, the MAH may be required to present specific documents to determine the safety, quality, and claimed benefits of the product. This shall be communicated to the MAH through the NOA, if applicable.\nc. MAHs with incomplete PIF shall be given sufficient amount of time ranging from fifteen to sixty (15-60) calendar days, depending on the urgency of the audit and classification of the deficiency/ies, to provide their corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan and other documents required by the PIF auditors. Notwithstanding the provided timeline for compliance to documentary requirements, the FDA may conduct further regulatory actions and direct further compliance pursuant to the succeeding provisions on the resolution of deficiencies.\nE. Deficiencies. For purposes of transparency, clarity and efficiency, non-conformances found during PIF Audits shall be classified and treated as follows:\n\n Classification of Deficiencies. The classification of deficiencies shall be as follows. An illustrative, non-exhaustive list of observations is attached as ANNEX B classified following the foregoing definitions as provided. The FDA shall endeavour to publish an updated list, based on the review of the implementation of this Circular.\n\na. Critical deficiency \u2013 a deficiency which has produced, or may lead to, a significant risk of producing either a product which is harmful to humans. It also covers findings of the establishment\u2019s or its agent\u2019s commission of fraud, misrepresentation or falsification of products, records or data, or withhold any relevant data contrary to the provisions of law, rules and regulations or appropriate standards.\nb. Major deficiency \u2013 a deficiency which indicates a major deviation from the terms of the marketing authorization, ASEAN Cosmetic Directive, its annexes and appendices, and other internationally-accepted standards; or, a combination of several \u201cother\u201d deficiencies, none of which on their own may be major, but which may together represent a major deficiency and should be explained and reported as such; or, repetitive deviation for at least two consecutive audits.\nc. Other deficiency \u2013 a deficiency which cannot be classified as either critical or major, but which indicates a departure from the ACD, its annexes and appendices, and other internationally-accepted standards. A deficiency may be \u201cother\u201d either because it is judged as minor, or because there is insufficient information to classify it as major or critical.\n\nResolution of Deficiencies. Deficiencies shall be treated and resolved as follows:\n\na. In case of findings classified as critical deficiency (ies), the PIF auditor is authorized to direct the establishment to initiate outright, any or all of the following:\ni. Address the deficiencies, including submission of CAPA plan and objective evidence of compliance, not later than thirty (30) calendar days reckoned on the day following the receipt of the audit report.\nii. Undertake or cause company-initiated recall of affected batches following existing FDA rules and procedure for product recall;\niii. Temporarily stop production of affected product line/s and further importation and/or distribution;\nCritical findings may result in the FDA imposing subsequent regulatory action, including but not limited to issuance of notice of product recall, disapproval of application, suspension or revocation of the issued authorization.\nb. In case of major and other deficiencies, the PIF auditor is authorized to direct the establishment to address the deficiencies, including the submission of CAPA Plan and objective evidence of compliance, not later than sixty (60) calendar days reckoned on the day following the receipt of the audit report.\nc. Failure to sufficiently comply and address the deficiencies during the provided compliance period may result in the FDA imposing subsequent regulatory action, including but not limited to issuance of notice of product recall, disapproval of application, suspension or revocation of the issued authorization.\nVI. PENALTY CLAUSE\nAny establishment found to be in violation of the provisions of this Circular shall be deemed in violation of Republic Act No. 3720 as amended by Republic Act No. 9711 and shall be penalized accordingly following the Uniform Rules of Procedures laid down under Book III of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9711.\nVII.

Corrections are needed in order to provide clarity and legal certainty to food business operators and to the Member States\u2019 competent authorities, thus ensuring the proper implementation and use of the Union list of novel foods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nThe conditions of use of the novel food \u2018bovine milk basic whey protein isolate\u2019, authorised by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1632 (4), were subsequently extended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686 (5). In Table 1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686, the lines separating the specified food categories and the maximum authorised levels were erroneously omitted, thereby making unclear what food category corresponds to what authorised use. That might create confusion for enforcement authorities and the food business operators. Therefore, a correction of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686 and Table 1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nThe novel food \u20183'-Sialyllactose sodium salt (microbial source)\u2019 was authorised by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/96 (6). The maximum levels indicated for the food category \u2018Flavoured fermented milk-based products including heat-treated products\u2019 were erroneously added to the food category \u2018Unflavoured fermented milk-based products\u2019, and vice versa. Therefore, a correction of Table 1 of Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/96 and Table 1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nThe novel food \u2018Galacto-oligosaccharide\u2019 was authorised under certain conditions of use pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97. The microbial source \u2018Bacillus circulans\u2019 of the enzyme \u2018\u03b2-galactosidase\u2019 used for the production of the Galacto-oligosaccharide was erroneously added to the specifications. Therefore, this source of \u03b2-galactosidase should be removed from the entry \u2018Galacto-oligosaccharide\u2019 in Table 2 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nThe novel food \u2018Xylo-oligosaccharide\u2019 was authorised under certain conditions of use by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1648 (7), based on a favourable opinion on the safety of the novel food by the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019). The specifications of the syrup form of \u2018Xylo-oligosaccharide\u2019 erroneously did not contain the parameter \u2018dry material\u2019 in the corresponding column. This error has been corrected in the revised scientific opinion of the Authority (8). Therefore, the specifications concerning \u2018Xylo-oligosaccharide\u2019 in Table 2 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 and in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1648 should be corrected accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1648, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/96 should therefore be corrected accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(9)\n\n\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,\n\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 is corrected in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 2\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1648 is corrected in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 3\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686 is corrected in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 4\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2021/96 is corrected in accordance with Annex IV to this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 5\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 6 January 2023.\n\n\nFor the Commission\n\n\nThe President\n\nUrsula VON DER LEYEN\n\n\n\n\n(1) OJ L 327, 11.12.2015, p. 1.\n\n(2)  Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1).\n\n(3)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 of 20 December 2017 establishing the Union list of novel foods in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods (OJ L 351, 30.12.2017, p. 72).\n\n(4)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1632 of 30 October 2018 authorising the placing on the market of bovine milk basic whey protein isolate as a novel food under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 (OJ L 272, 31.10.2018, p. 23).\n\n(5)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1686 of 8 October 2019 authorising the extension of use of bovine milk basic whey protein isolate as a novel food under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 (OJ L 258, 9.10.2019, p. 13).\n\n(6)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/96 of 28 January 2021 authorising the placing on the market of 3'-sialyllactose sodium salt as a novel food under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 (OJ L 31, 29.1.2021, p. 201).\n\n(7)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1648 of 29 October 2018 authorising the placing on the market of xylo-oligosaccharides as a novel food under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 (OJ L 275, 6.11.2018, p. 1).\n\n(8)  EFSA Journal 2018;16(7):5361.\n\n\n\n\nANNEX I\nCorrection of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 is corrected as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\nin Table 1 (Authorised novel foods), the entry for \u2018Bovine milk basic whey protein isolate\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorised novel food\n\n\nConditions under which the novel food may be used\n\n\nAdditional specific labelling requirements\n\n\nOther requirements\n\n\nData Protection\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Bovine milk basic whey protein isolate\n\n\n\n\nSpecified food category\n\n\n\n\nMaximum levels\n\n\n\nThe designation of the novel food on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u201cMilk whey protein isolate\u201d.\nFood supplements containing bovine milk basic whey protein isolate shall bear the following statement:\n\u201cThis food supplement should not be consumed by infants/children/adolescents under the age of one/three/eighteen (*) years\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(*)\n\n\nDepending on the age group the food supplement is intended for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAuthorised on 20 November 2018.

{"id": "REG_20776548", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. RATIONALE\nPursuant to Republic Act No. 9711 otherwise known as \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009\u201d, the FDA is mandated to \u201cdevelop and issue policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines that would cover establishments, facilities and health products\u201d. Further, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10611 otherwise known as the \u201cFood Safety Act of 2013\u201d states that the FDA shall be responsible for developing, adopting and/or amending/revising food safety standards and codes of practice for processed and prepackaged foods. This is aligned with the end goal of ensuring the safety and quality of processed food products available for the general public.\nLarge and small food companies introduce an estimated 15,000 new food products every year. Hence, there is a need to update existing food policies to keep up with innovations in processed food. FDA Circular No. 2013-010 or \u201cRevised Guidelines for the Assessment of Microbiological Quality of Processed Foods\u201d was implemented in 2013, and it was reviewed by the Common Services Laboratory (CSL) and Center for Food Regulation and Research (CFRR) of the FDA to consider the addition of new food categories and update the microbiological specifications of certain food products. The methods to be used for the enumeration or detection of specified microorganisms shall be those that have been adopted from locally and internationally established references as provided in Annex B.\nThis Circular is hereby issued to repeal FDA Circular No. 2013-010 entitled \u201cRevised Guidelines for the Assessment of Microbiological Quality of Processed Foods\u201d and to provide the updated guidelines on the microbiological requirements and assessment of certain prepackaged processed food products.\nII. OBJECTIVES \nThe objectives of this Circular are the following:\nA. To revise and update the guidance document in the assessment of microbiological quality of prepackaged processed food products.\nB. To align the guidelines on the microbiological requirements and assessment of prepackaged processed food products with local and international standards.\nIII. SCOPE\nThis Circular covers imported and locally produced prepackaged processed food products under the jurisdiction of the FDA.\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\nA. Aerobic Plate Count (APC) as a routine test provides an estimate of the total number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria in a sample without differentiating among the various types. This analysis can be used as a general index of the bacterial population, and to obtain the general information on the sanitary quality of products, manufacturing practices, raw materials, processing conditions, handling practices & shelf-life.\nB. Bacillus cereus is an aerobic, sporulating, Gram-positive, motile, catalase positive bacterium that is commonly found in soil, on vegetables, and in many raw and processed foods.  cereus food poisoning may occur when foods are prepared and held without adequate refrigeration for several hours before serving. Foods incriminated in past outbreaks include cooked meat and vegetables, boiled or fried rice, vanilla sauce, custards, soups, and raw vegetable sprouts.\nC. Campylobacter are microaerophilic, non-sporulating, Gram-negative, motile bacteria. The species of greatest interest in foods is  jejuni, and, to a lesser extent, C. coli.\u00a0 C. jejuni is not an environmental organism but rather is one that is associated with warm-blooded animals. A large percentage of all major meat animals has been shown to contain these organisms in their feces, with poultry being prominent\nD. Clostridium perfringens is a strictly anaerobic, sporulating, Gram-positive, non-motile, catalase negative bacterium.\u00a0 Food poisoning due to  perfringens may occur when foods such as meat or poultry are cooked and held without maintaining adequate temperature before serving. The presence of small numbers of C. perfringens is not uncommon in raw meats, poultry, dehydrated soups and sauces, raw vegetables, and spices \u00a0\nE. Coliforms refer to a group of facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that \u00a0ferments lactose to \u00a0produce \u00a0acid \u00a0and \u00a0gas within \u00a048 \u00a0h \u00a0at \u00a035\u00b0C.\u00a0 Its\n\u00a0detection is used as an indicator of sanitary quality of water or as a general indicator of sanitary condition in the food-processing environment.\nF. Commercial sterility means the absence of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal nonrefrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage.\nG. Cronobacter are facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-negative, motile, catalase positive bacteria. They are opportunistic pathogens that have been linked with serious infections in infants.\nH. Enterobacteriaceae is a family of gram-negative, non-spore forming bacteria that includes many bacteria that are found in human or animal intestinal tracts, as well as plants and the environment. The family includes a number of foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella, pathogenic  coli, Shigella and Cronobacter, as well as non-pathogenic bacteria.\nI. Escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-negative bacterium, which belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is widely distributed in the intestine of humans and warm-blooded animals and is used to indicate recent fecal contamination or unsanitary processing.\nJ. Fecal streptococci are coccoid-shaped, chain forming, Gram positive bacteria of intestinal origin. The normal habitat of this microorganism is the intestinal tract of human beings and warmblooded animals and their presence in water indicates fecal contamination.\nK. Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) \u2013 formerly known as standard plate count, is a procedure for estimating the number of live, culturable heterotrophic (use organic compounds as energy sources in their metabolism) bacteria in water.\nL. High-risk population \u2013 certain group of people more likely to get sick and to have a more serious illness. These groups are composed of adults aged 65 and older, children younger than 5 years, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women.\nM. Lactic acid bacteria are Gram-positive, acid tolerant, rods or cocci that usually produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation.\nN. Listeria is a genus of facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive, motile or non-motile bacteria. Among the six species under it, only  monocytogenes is commonly associated with human listeriosis.\u00a0 The psychrotrophic nature of L. monocytogenes is a problem for the food industry.\u00a0 Post-process re-contamination is one of the most common causes of L. monocytogenes in the final product.\u00a0 Foods that have been associated with the transmission of L. monocytogenes include raw milk, inadequately \u00a0pasteurized \u00a0milk, \u00a0chocolate \u00a0\u00a0milk, \u00a0soft \u00a0fresh \u00a0cheeses, \u00a0sorbets, raw\nvegetables, \u00a0bovine \u00a0and \u00a0poultry \u00a0meats, meat products (sausages raw fermented sausages, hot dog type sausages), raw and smoked fish and seafood.\nO. Lot refers to a set of units of a product which has been produced and/or manufactured and/or packaged under similar conditions. A lot can consist of several batches.\nP. Mesophilic bacteria \u2013 microorganisms that grows at moderate temperatures between 20\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C and with an optimum temperature in the range of 30-39\u00b0C.\nQ. Osmophilic yeasts \u2013 yeast that are capable of growing in high concentrations of organic solutes, particularly in sugars. Osmophilic yeasts are usually the cause of spoilage of high-sugar foods, including jams, honey, concentrated fruit juices, chocolate candy with soft centers etc.\nR. Process hygiene indicators \u2013 criteria applied to the finished product (powder form) or any other previous point that provides the information for the purpose of verification. The criteria is intended to be used by the manufacturer as a means of on-going assessment of their hygiene programs.\nS. Pseudomonas aeruginosa \u2013 gram negative, non-spore forming rod which is oxidase and catalase positive. It is an opportunistic pathogen of man that is capable of growth in water at very low nutrient concentrations.\nT. Salmonella is a genus of facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-negative bacterium, which also belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Members of this genus are infectious pathogens capable of initiating clinical symptoms in humans.\u00a0 It is one of four key global causes of diarrheal diseases.\u00a0 The disease is generally contracted through the consumption of contaminated foods of animal origin (meats, poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products, fish, shrimp) but fresh produce (fruits and vegetables such tomatoes, peppers and cantaloupes) and low-moisture foods (such as spices) also have been implicated in transmission.\nU. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, non-sporulating, non-motile, catalase-positive, and coagulase-positive bacterium. The production of coagulase is considered as an indication of pathogenicity among the species of Staphylococcus.\u00a0 aureus is predominantly associated with the skin, skin glands and mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals. Thus, the presence of this bacterium or its enterotoxins in processed foods or on food processing equipment is generally an indication of poor sanitation.\nV. Thermophilic spores \u2013 spores from thermophilic bacteria (thermophiles) or bacteria that grow optimally at 55\u00b0C but can grow up to 65\u00b0C.\nW. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-sporulating, motile, halophilic bacterium.  parahaemolyticus is a curve-shaped rod naturally present in coastal and estuarine waters. It is halophilic (salt-loving) and is lysed almost immediately in freshwater. It \u00a0is \u00a0a \u00a0marine microorganism native in estuarine\nwaters throughout the world.\u00a0 Its pathogenic strains cause disease worldwide, although most common in Asia and the United States. Molluscan shellfish, such as oysters, clams, and mussels raw or undercooked are the most common foods associated with V. parahaemolyticus infection.\nX. Water activity (Aw) is the quotient of the water vapor pressure of the substance divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. It is an indication of the amount of free water in food that supports microbial growth, and participates in and supports chemical and enzymatic reactions and spoilage processes.\nY. Yeast-like fungi also known as dimorphic fungi corresponds to fungi that can change from yeast form to mycelial form in response to changes in environmental factors. May be basidiomycetes such as Cryptococcus neoformans or ascomycetes such as Candida albicans\n\u00a0\nV. GUIDELINES\nA. All food business operators and market authorization holders shall adhere to these guidelines for the microbiological specifications of prepackaged processed food products. Compliance of the finished product to Annex A of this Circular ensures the safety and quality of the processed food product.\nB. The guidelines shall be the basis for evaluation of microbiological properties of food products during application for product registration. The details on how to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) are stated in FDA Circular No. 2020-033 or \u201cProcedure for the Use of the Modified Electronic Registration System for Raw Materials and Prepackaged Processed Food Products Repealing FDA Circular No. 2016-014 \u201cProcedure for the Use of Electronic Registration System for Prepackaged Processed Food Products\u201d or its future amendments.\nC. The guidelines contain reference criteria as prescribed in Tables 1-14. The tables contain descriptions of the food group to which specific criteria apply, the required test(s) for microorganisms considered, and the number of samples that should conform to the limits. New food categories such as pre-packaged tubed and cubed ice, ethnic milk-based confectioneries, and instant noodles, among others, have been added.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVI. PENALTY CLAUSE\n\u00a0\nAny food product that are non-compliant to, or in violation of, the reference criteria shall be deemed not in conformity with the applicable food quality or safety standard or either adulterated, misbranded, mislabelled or both, as the case may be.

{"id": "REG_20776508", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. RATIONALE\nPursuant to Section 2 Article II Book I of the Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of Republic Act 9711 otherwise known as \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009\u201d, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is mandated to develop and issue policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines that would cover establishments, facilities, and health products. Health products as defined in the said Act refer to the products that may have an effect on health that requires regulation as determined by the FDA. Food Contact Articles (FCA) are health products constituting chemicals that can migrate from the materials into food. As these chemicals migrate, they may alter the characteristics of the food unacceptably or have adverse effects on the taste and/or odor of foods (Linssen, 1992).\nRegulation of FCA is specified in R.A. 10611 also known as the Food Safety Act of 2013 which states that food is adulterated if it is in a container having in whole or in part any poisonous or deleterious substance. Moreover, any food packaging material which results or may reasonably be expected to result, or indirectly in it becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food is considered a food additive according to the Bureau Circular 2006-016 or the Updated List of Food Additives.\nHence, the determination of the suitability of the Food Contact Articles for use in the packing, packaging, transporting, or holding of food shall be conducted by the FDA Common Services Laboratory (CSL) to carry out the foregoing laws.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\nTo provide guidelines on the procedure for the voluntary certification of Food Contact Articles. Specific Objectives of this are as follows:\n\nTo establish the guidelines on the conduct of voluntary certification of food contact articles used for prepackaged processed food products.\nTo provide information on the process of application for the voluntary certification to the stakeholders involved.\n\nIII. SCOPE\nThis Circular shall cover both locally manufactured and imported food contact articles,\u00a0 in finished or final form, with or without applied adhesives and/or printing inks, limited to:\nA.

BACKGROUND\nRepublic Act No. 3720, otherwise known as the \u201cFood, Drugs and Devices, and Cosmetics Act\u201d, as amended by Republic Act No. 9711, otherwise known as the \u201cFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Act of 2009\u201d, and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, declare that it is the policy of the state to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of drug supply in the country so as to protect the health of the Filipino people. The FDA, as the national regulatory authority (NRA) in the country, together with the Department of Health (DOH), are tasked to ensure that there is (1) a constant supply of drugs, including vaccines, and (2) facilitated access to safe, effective, and quality drugs.\nIn 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued the initial collaborative review procedure under Annex 4 of WHO Technical Report Series (TRS) No. 981, 2013. The FDA signed up as a participating NRA to this collaborative procedure in 20151 and has since applied the procedure in the review of applications for initial registration of WHO-prequalified pharmaceutical products including vaccines. In 2016, a revised procedure was issued under Annex 8 of WHO TRS No. 996. This was adopted through Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0044 entitled Adoption of the Collaborative Procedure for the Accelerated Registration of World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Prequalified Pharmaceutical Products and Vaccines.\nGiven the current resource constraints affecting drug regulation, collaboration and regulatory convergence with international organizations such as the WHO are necessary.\nThis Circular is issued to guide and provide the activities that must be undertaken by the concerned stakeholders who will be affected by the implementation of the collaborative procedure for accelerated registration.\nII. OBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to provide the implementing guidelines of AO No. 2020-0044 which adopted the collaborative procedure for accelerated registration of WHO-prequalified pharmaceutical products including vaccines.\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\nThis Circular covers applications for the registration and the post-approval change/s of WHO-prequalified \u00a0pharmaceutical \u00a0products \u00a0including \u00a0vaccines\u00a0 \u00a0and \u00a0biologicals \u00a0as defined in Section IV below, and shall apply to all FDA licensed drug manufacturers, traders, and distributors.\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\nCollaborative procedure for accelerated registration of WHO-prequalified pharmaceutical products and vaccines, also referred to as collaborative review procedure or collaborative registration procedure (CRP), refers to the procedure for collaboration between the WHO Prequalification Team (WHO/PQT) and interested NRAs in the assessment and accelerated national registration of WHO-prequalified pharmaceutical products and vaccine.2\nNational regulatory authority (NRA) is responsible for ensuring that products released for public distribution such as pharmaceuticals, biological products such as vaccines, and medical devices including test kits are evaluated properly and meet international standards of quality and safety and efficacy.3\nWHO-prequalified pharmaceutical products including vaccines refers to those products which have undergone the WHO prequalification wherein comprehensive ongoing requirements stipulated by the WHO are applied to ensure that the products are safe, efficacious, appropriate, and meet stringent quality standards. The mission of WHO prequalification is to work in close cooperation with NRAs and other partner organizations to make quality priority medical products available for those who urgently need them.4\nV. IMPLEMENTING DETAILS\nA. General Guidelines\n1.

The harmonization scheme aims to eliminate restrictions to trade of cosmetic products and enhance cooperation within the ASEAN Member States (AMS) in ensuring the safety, quality and claimed benefits of cosmetic products.\nUnder the ACD, the AMS, through the National Regulatory Authorities (NRA), shall undertake all necessary measures to ensure that only cosmetic products that conform to the provisions of the ACD, its Annexes and Appendices may be placed in the market.\nAmidst challenges brought about by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the ASEAN Cosmetic Committee (ACC) Meeting and Its Related Meetings, through the ASEAN Secretariat, were held virtually as follows:\n\n\n\nDate\nMeeting\n\n\n10-11 May 2022\n35th ASEAN Cosmetic Scientific Body (ACSB) Meeting\n\n\n11-12 May 2022\n18th ASEAN Cosmetic Testing Laboratories Committee (ACTLC) Meeting\n\n\n23-24 May 2022\nASEAN Cosmetic Committee Heads of Delegations (HODs) Meeting\n\n\n25 & 27 May 2022\n35th ACC Meeting\n\n\n\n\nTo provide the industry with timely and relevant information on standards, rules, and regulations and to establish the implementation timeline or grace period to allow sufficient time for the industry to conduct operational activities (i.e. reformulation and phase out of products with old formulation), the Center for Cosmetics and Household/Urban Hazardous Substances Regulation and Research (CCHUHSRR), hereby, reports the highlights of the aforementioned meetings and presents the updates to the ASEAN Cosmetic Directive (ACD) as adopted in the 35th ACC Meeting.\nII. OBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to provide the updates and amendments to the ACD as adopted in the 35th ACC meeting and its related meetings, including its implementation timeline or grace period to allow sufficient time for the industry to conduct relevant operational activities and ensure continued compliance with the ACD, which covers cosmetic products made available in the local market.\nThis Circular aims to provide the updates and amendments to the ACD as adopted in the 35th ACC meeting and its related meetings, including its implementation timeline or grace period to allow sufficient time for the industry to conduct relevant operational activities and ensure continued compliance with the ACD, which covers cosmetic products made available in the local market.\nIII. SCOPE\nThis Circular applies to establishments that are engaged in the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offer for sale, distribution, donation, transfer, and where applicable, the use, testing, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of cosmetic products.\nIV. UPDATES AND AMENDMENTS TO THE ACD\nA. Updates and Amendments to the ACD Ingredient Annexes\nThe following are the updates and amendments on cosmetic ingredients and their restrictions as indicated in the ACD Ingredient Annexes. The latest revision of the ACD Ingredient Annexes is accessible at the FDA website.\nFor reference, the new and modified entries as well as the given grace period are listed in Annex A.\n1. Climbazole (Annex III \u2013 List of substances which cosmetic products must not contain except subject to restrictions and conditions laid down, Ref. No. 326 and Annex VI \u2013 List of preservatives allowed for use in cosmetic products, Ref. No. 32)\nReferring to the proposed options provided by ASEAN Cosmetics Association (ACA), Brunei proposed that if foot care products are not extensively used in ASEAN Member States (AMS), removing this product type in the list may be considered. The product mix would then include \u2013 shampoo (2% as anti-dandruff) + hair lotion + face cream + hair conditioner (0.5%) with the Margin of Safety (MOS) = 116.\nThe AMS, except Myanmar, agreed to Brunei\u2019s proposal and adopted the option of the above list of products (without foot care) for the Climbazole entry in ACD Annexes VI and III (0.5% rinse-off hair conditioner) with a grace period of 18 months \u2013 Effective 11 November 2023, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. The ACSB Secretary will inform Myanmar on the adoption and request her position.\n2. Titanium Dioxide (Annex III \u2013 List of substances which cosmetic products must not contain except subject to restrictions and conditions laid down, Ref. No. 338) (EU 2021/850)\nRecalling that based on the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) conclusion, the use of Titanium Dioxide in powder form containing 1% or more of particles with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 10 \u03bcm should not be authorized for use in applications that may give rise to inhalation exposure by the end user and added to the list of restricted substances in EU Annex III for use as face products in loose powder form and in hair aerosol spray products. The use of titanium dioxide as colorant (entry 143 of EU Annex IV) and as UV filter (entry 27 of EU Annex VI) are updated to reflect the restricted use.\nACA presented the safety assessment on Titanium Dioxide and highlighted that the CMR 2 classification of the substance is mainly on the inhalation route and not on oral and dermal routes. In their review of the SCCS safety assessment, ACA proposed to adopt the EU amendment for the Titanium Dioxide entry in ACD Annex III with a grace period of 24 months.\nThe AMS, except Myanmar, agreed to the ACA proposal including the grace period \u2013 Effective 11 May 2024, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. The ACSB Secretary will inform Myanmar on the adoption and request her position.\n 3.

No. 60 (EU 2019/1858)\nACA presented the SCCS safety assessment of 4-(3-ethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one (HEPB) as a preservative. With the SCCS assessment affirming the safety via MOS calculation of the substance in oral care and dermally applied products, ACA proposed to adopt the EU amendment and include HEPB as a new entry in ACD Annex VI.\nIt was agreed in the meeting to adopt the ACA proposal effective immediately. Thailand will implement within the next 6 months as she needs to go through her process of issuing local regulations. The ACSB Secretary will inform Myanmar on the adoption and request her position.\n4. Amendment of Annex III \u2013 List of substances which cosmetic products must not contain except subject to restrictions and conditions laid down, Ref.

The AMS, except Myanmar, agreed to the ACA proposal to add the entry of Deoxyarbutin in ACD Annex II with a grace period of 12 months \u2013 Effective 11 May 2023, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. It was noted that the ban is already implemented in Indonesia per her local regulation.\nb. Additionally, it was agreed in the meeting to adopt the EU Regulation and amend the current entry of Dihydroxyacetone in ACD Annex III, with a grace period of 18 months \u2013 Effective 11 November 2023, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. Indonesia also added to reflect \u201cUse for dyeing eyelashes and eyebrows is not permitted\u201d in this entry as this is the standing agreement on use of dyes in ASEAN.\nc. The ACSB Secretary will inform Myanmar on the adoption and request her position.\n6. Amendment of Annex II \u2013 List of substances which must not form part of the composition of cosmetic products, Ref. No. 573\nThe AMS agreed to ACA\u2019s proposal to remove CAS # 68171-33-5 from ACD Annex II Entry 573 as this is not included in Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009.\n7.

BACKGROUND\nFDA Circular No. 2017-013: \u201cGuidelines on the Issuance of Clearance for Customs Release (CFCR) of Radiation Devices by the Food and Drug Administration \u2013 Center for Device Regulation, Radiation Health, and Research (FDA-CDRRHR)\u201d, was issued to rationalize the guidelines for the regulation of the importation of radiation devices used for both medical and non-medical applications. The issuance intended to provide regulatory action while the FDA is in the process of developing guidelines for medical device registration.\nOn January 2018, DOH Administrative Order No. 2018-0002 entitled, \u201cGuidelines Governing the Issuance of an Authorization for a Medical Device based on the ASEAN Harmonized Technical Requirements\u201d was issued to provide guidelines on the documentary requirements for the registration of medical devices based on the provisions of the ASEAN Medical Device Directive through a phased implementation specified through FDA Circular No. 2021-002 and its amendments.\nAs such, an amendment of the provisions of FDA Circular No. 2017-013 is needed to align with DOH AO No. 2018-0002. Specifically, all medical radiation devices shall also be classified in accordance with the agreed classification of the ASEAN Consultative Committee on Standards and Quality \u2013 Medical Device Product Working Group (ACCSQ-MDPWG). The registration of such devices shall also be covered and regulated by the specific and procedural guidelines of the AO.\nIn view thereof, this amendment aims to provide for the updated guidelines for the customs release of imported medical radiation devices harmonizing with current processes for other devices regulated by the FDA.\nII. OBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to align and amend FDA Circular No. 2017-013 with provisions of DOH AO No. 2018-0002 and provide guidelines for medical radiation devices in line with the phased implementation of the AO specified through FDA Circular No. 2021-002 and its amendments.\nIII.

With the issuance of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0045, entitled, \u201cEstablishing Facilitated Registration Pathways for Drug Products, including Vaccines and Biologicals\u201d, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized that instituting good reliance practices would be impactful toward facilitating access to drugs by producing more efficient regulatory mechanisms.\nThe World Health Organization, in its Technical Report Series No. 1033, Annex 10 \u2013 Good reliance practices in the regulation of medical products: high-level principles and considerations, defines reliance as \u201cthe act whereby the regulatory authority in one jurisdiction takes into account and gives significant weight to assessments performed by another regulatory authority or trusted institution, or to any other authoritative information, in reaching its own decision. The relying authority remains independent, responsible, and accountable for the decisions taken, even when it relies on the decisions, assessments, and information of others.\u201d\nIn applying regulatory reliance, the FDA shall be streamlining its regulatory review to accelerate the registration process of drug products by leveraging against product regulatory assessments made by reference drug regulatory agencies (RDRAs). Simultaneously, strengthened post-marketing surveillance shall ensue and continuous improvement in building FDA\u2019s institutional capacity to effectively oversee innovative and complex advancements of drug products shall remain in the long term. Thus, pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 3720 as amended by RA No. 9711, the FDA hereby provides the implementation arrangements for the abridged and verification review pathways stipulated in AO No. 2020-0045 through this Circular as a pragmatic approach to institutionalizing regulatory reliance.\nII. OBJECTIVE\nThis Circular aims to provide the implementing guidelines of AO No. 2020-0045 on the facilitated registration pathways (FRPs) through abridged review or verification review of new drugs, including vaccines and biologicals.\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\u00a0\nThis Circular covers applications of new drugs including vaccines, and biologicals as defined in Section IV below, and shall apply to all licensed drug distributors intending to place in the local market or apply for post-approval changes of drug, vaccine, and biological products with existing and valid approval/s from RDRA/s.\nThis Circular only covers the abridged review and verification review types of FRP. For the collaborative procedure under AO No. 2020-0044 or the Adoption of the Collaborative Procedure for the Accelerated Registration of World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Prequalified Pharmaceutical Products and Vaccines, the implementing guidelines shall be covered by a separate Circular.\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\nAbridged review refers to a limited independent assessment of specific parts of the dossier, or submission for suitability of use under local conditions and regulatory requirements while relying on prior assessment from an RDRA to inform the local decision. The review is based on a complete assessment report, including question and answer documents, and the dossier including the stability data.\nVerification review refers to an assessment process by which the submission has been evaluated and approved by at least two (2) RDRAs, and the FDA only validates the submission and ensures that the product conforms to the registration conditions, standards, and requirements as approved by the RDRAs.\nA new drug application refers to a local registration application for a product that contains new chemical and/or biological entities proposed to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, new dosage forms, new dosage strengths, new routes of administration, and new indications. All generic products with FDA-approved equivalents shall not be considered new drugs.\nReference Drug Regulatory Agency (RDRA) refers to a national or regional regulatory agency for drugs, vaccines, and biologicals being relied upon by the FDA for a more efficient approach at arriving at a decision thereby improving and expediting quality assured, effective, and safe products.\nAssessment Report refers to the complete, unredacted, or unedited copy of the assessment reports of the marketing authorization application and evaluated by the RDRA. The Assessment Report details and explains how the RDRA assessed the safety, quality, and efficacy data and information within the submitted dossier to inform its final decision on the regulatory action. The Assessment Report outlines the area of concerns, questions and answers, and clarifications which the RDRA raised and how these were addressed by the applicant and includes the product approval conditions, the final and approved product labeling, and all other annexes.\nV.

{"id": "REG_20776516", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE\n\u00a0According to the World Health Organization Fact Sheets on Mercury and Health, mercury is considered as one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern. Exposure to mercury even small amounts may cause serious health problems and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes.\nMercury is used in a wide variety of medical devices such as thermometers, sphygmomanometers, gastrointestinal devices and dental amalgams. Considering this fact, mercury exposure is possible to all the users of the aforementioned devices.\nWith the recognition that mercury is a threat to public health, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing Council agreed in 2009 to the elaboration of a legally binding instrument on mercury. To support this global treaty, the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force on August 2017 which is a global treaty that aims to protect human health and the environment from the anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. In support, the government of the Philippines signed the Instrument of Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury on 02 June 2020. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), being the agency mandated to regulate medical devices decided that it is imperative for the FDA to sustain the government\u2019s effort in phasing out mercury-added products by issuing a policy to further strengthen the Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\nParagraph 1 of Article 4 on Mercury-added products of the Minamata Convention provides that the manufacture, import or export of mercury-added products listed in Part I of Annex A after the phase-out date specified for those products shall not be allowed by the Party or the country bound by the Convention. Such list includes thermometer and sphygmomanometer whose phase out date was stated to be 2020.\nMoreover, Paragraph 3 of the aforementioned Article on Mercury-added products of the Minamata Convention cited that each Party shall take measures to phase down the use of dental amalgam taking into account the country\u2019s domestic circumstances and relevant international guidance.\nIn line with the above-mentioned global treaty on mercury in which the Philippines signed in October 2013, the Department of Health (DOH) has implemented measures or strategies to reduce the use of mercury-added products.\nOn 14 May 2020, DOH Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0020 entitled \u201cGuidelines on the Phase-out of Mercury use in Dental Restorative Procedures\u201d was issued pursuant to Republic Act 11223 otherwise known as the \u201cUniversal Health Care Act\u201d and took effect on 06 June 2020 to adopt a phase-out policy of dental amalgams. Under this policy, the use of dental amalgams / capsules for dental restoration procedures in dental clinics and schools shall no longer be allowed after the phase-out period of three (3) years from the effectivity of the said Order. To date, the result of the implementation of AO 2020-0020 is the exclusion of dental amalgam and its capsules as well as liquid mercury from the list of registrable medical devices in the Philippines.\nPrior to the issuance of AO No. 2020-0020, DOH has already issued AO No. 2008-0021 entitled \u201cGradual Phase-out of Mercury in all Philippine Health Care Facilities and Institutions\u201d on 30 July 2008 to cautiously phase out mercury in all health care facilities and institutions. Meanwhile, BAN Toxics, a non-government environmental organization based in the Philippines, conducted a research and produced a paper on the \u201cSituation Assessment of Mercury-Containing Medical Measuring Devices in the Philippines\u201d that contained data collection and analysis results based on the implementation of the abovementioned AO which have been eventually reviewed and approved by their project implementing agency, the Asian Institute for Technology, Regional Resource Center for Asia and the Pacific as well as their partners at the Hazardous Waste Management Section. Also, it was presented and approved at the National Stakeholder Workshop held on 06 September 2021. (Please refer to Annex 1). Based on their data, the implementation of the aforesaid AO was successful. However, we cannot neglect the fact that in the period from 2010 to 2020, there are still hospitals that purchased mercury-added medical devices.\nDespite the policies that have been implemented in today\u2019s era when internet is accessible, the promotion, advertisement, sale and offer for sale of mercury-added medical devices has become widespread on various digital platforms including social media or through online shopping platforms. The policies issued do not address the online sale of mercury-added medical devices.\nThe Food and Drug Administration, by virtue of Republic Act No. 9711 also known as the \u201cFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Act of 2009, is mandated to protect public health and safety through effective regulation of medical devices in the country. To address the current issues arising from the rampant sale of mercury-added medical devices through various digital platforms and to totally ban such devices in the country, this Circular is hereby issued.\nII. OBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to totally ban the manufacture, importation, exportation, distribution, sale, offer for sale, donation, transfer, and where applicable, the use, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of mercury-added thermometers and sphygmomanometers along with dental amalgam capsules and liquid mercury for use in dental restorative purposes to protect human health from the adverse effects of mercury-added medical devices.\nIII. SCOPE\nThis Circular shall cover establishments that are engaged in the manufacture, distribution, importation, exportation, sale, offer for sale, donation, transfer, and where applicable, the use, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of mercury-added thermometers and sphygmomanometers as well as dental amalgam capsules and liquid mercury for use in dental restorative purposes.\nThis issuance shall not cover medical devices containing mercury that as of the moment do not have effective alternative technology and /or considered gold standard that are used\nin the laboratory to test the accuracy of similar medical devices. Such similar medical devices are considered alternate to the gold standard mercury containing medical device.\nIV.

No. 336 and 337 and Annex VI \u2013 List of preservatives allowed for use in cosmetic products, Ref. No. 28\nDuring the 31st ACSB Meeting, there are balance substances classified as CMR substances category 2 under EU 2019/831 that need further review. These are the following: trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide (Annex III \u2013 restricted ingredient), furfural (Annex III \u2013 restricted ingredient) and polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (Annex V \u2013 preservative). While these substances were classified as CMRs under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, there are SCCS Opinions which support that these ingredients can be used for certain types of cosmetic products within specific restrictions establishing the conditions laid down for CMRs are fulfilled. Therefore, these substances were incorporated into the EU Annexes as follows:\na. EU Annex III \u2013 Diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (Trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide (TPO) is safe when used as a nail product and added to the list of restricted substances in Annex III for professional use in artificial nail systems with a maximum concentration of 5 %.\nb. EU Annex III \u2013 2-Furaldehyde (Furfural) added to the list of restricted substances in Annex III with a maximum concentration of 0.001%.\nc. EU Annex V \u2013 Polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMB), (Polyaminopropyl Biguanide) added as a preservative in all cosmetic products, except in applications that may lead to exposure of the end-user\u2019s lungs by inhalation, with a maximum concentration of 0.1%. The conditions set out in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should be adapted accordingly.\nACA presented the safety data on PHMB which basically supports the SCCS Opinion on this ingredient, and in turn, requested sufficient grace period for implementation.\nIn consideration of the above, the AMS except for Indonesia agreed to adopt the revisions into the ACD Annexes III and VI respectively with the grace period of 18 months \u2013 Effective 06 April 2023, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. Indonesia will defer her decision until such time that the EU workshop is conducted.\n5. Silver Nitrate inclusion in Annex II \u2013 List of substances which must not form part of the composition of cosmetic products, Ref. No. A1143\nRecalling the 30th and 31st ACSB Meeting agreements to remove Silver Nitrate from Annex III as the intended use is as colorant for eyelashes/eye areas, there is a pending discussion whether this ingredient is used in cosmetics other than colorant or will be moved to ACD Annex II. As noted in the previous Meetings, there are no products in ASEAN except for Thailand, that contain Silver Nitrate.\nFollowing discussions, the AMS except for Thailand agreed to include Silver Nitrate in Annex II with a grace period of 12 months \u2013 Effective 06 October 2022, only compliant products shall be made available in the market and non-compliant products shall be withdrawn from the market. Thailand will make internal consultations on the time frame and inform in the next ACSB Meeting.\nV. PENALTY CLAUSE\nEstablishments engaged in the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offer for sale, distribution, donation, transfer, and where applicable, the use, testing, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of cosmetic products which are found to be operating in violation of the rules and regulations of FDA shall be subjected to sanctions and penalties as prescribed by Republic Act No. 9711, otherwise known as the \u201cFood and Drug Administration Act of 2009.\u201d\n\u00a0VI. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE\nThe provisions of this \u201cUpdates and Amendments to the ASEAN Cosmetic Directive (ACD) Ingredient Annexes\u201d are hereby declared separable and in the event of any such provision is/are declared invalid or unenforceable, the validity of enforceability of the remaining portions or provisions including other provisions of the ACD which are not affected by this updates/amendments, shall remain in full force and in effect.\u00a0\nVII.

{"id": "REG_20776487", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. RATIONALE\nOn 24 May 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued FDA Circular No. 2021-011 with subject, Extension of Transitory Period for the Implementation of FDA Circular No. 2020-025, \u201cImplementing Guidelines for Administrative Order No. 2019-0019\u201d wherein the Household/Urban Hazardous Substances (HUHS) industry was given until 31 December 2021 to comply with the new licensing and registration requirements for covered HUHS establishments and products, respectively. However, as the current transitory period draws to an end, appeals had been made by the HUHS industry and other concerned stakeholders for the FDA to give them a longer compliance period within which the covered HUHS establishments can secure the appropriate marketing authorization for their HUHS products as required by FDA Circular No. 2020-025.\nIn view of the foregoing and in consideration of the economic challenges brought about by the current state of calamity in the country due to COVID-19, the FDA recognizes the need to extend the current transitory period and assist the HUHS industry as they comply with the registration requirements of FDA Circular No. 2020-025.\nII. OBJECTIVES\nThis Circular aims to:\nA. Establish a 2-year transitory period extension for HUHS product registration; and,\nB. Establish an interim guideline for product registration as well as product labeling during the transitory period.\nIII. SCOPE\nThis issuance shall apply to products classified as Categories III and IV of HUHS as defined in Republic Act No. 9711 and categorized in FDA Circular No. 2020-025, and the establishments engaged or intending to engage in their manufacture, importation, exportation, distribution, sale, offer for sale, transfer, promotion, advertising and/or sponsorship. The covered Categories III and IV HUHS products shall be those intended for consumer or institutional use only and shall not covered those intended for industrial use.\nIV. GUIDELINES\nA. Two (2) \u2013 Year Transitory Period Extension\nThe 2-year transitory period extension shall start on 01 January 2022 and end on 31 December 2023.\n\nLicense to Operate (LTO)\n\nThe 2-year transitory period extension shall not apply to the licensing of HUHS establishments. Hence, effective 01 January 2022, a LTO as HUHS establishment shall be mandatory for all establishments engaged or intending to engage in HUHS-related activities.\n\nCertificate of Product Registration (CPR)\n\nThe 2-year transitory period extension shall apply to the registration of HUHS products. Hence, from 01 January 2022 to 31 December 2023, HUHS establishments may continue to distribute their HUHS products without a CPR from the FDA. However, effective 01 January 2024, a CPR shall be mandatory for all HUHS products distributed in the market.\nFurther, the 2-year transitory period extension shall serve as the exhaustion period within which the HUHS establishments may deplete the remaining stocks of HUHS products with labels that are not compliant with the labeling requirements set forth in Annex J of FDA Circular No. 2020-025 including the GHS label elements.\nAs such, for the purposes of HUHS product registration, the FDA shall accept complete, loose artwork of existing labels of all packaging sizes of the product, as applicable, regardless of compliance to Annex J of FDA Circular No. 2020-025 as this shall be the basis for the additional conditions that the HUHS establishment must comply with at the end of the transitory period upon implementation of the full labeling requirements. Notwithstanding the acceptance of loose artwork of existing HUHS product labels, all product claims reflected on said labels shall be substantiated by sufficient documentation during product registration.\n\nOther authorizations including Customs Clearances, Sales and Promo Permit and Certificate of Free Sale (CFS)\n\nSecuring Sales and Promo Permits for products covered by this Circular are not mandatory, including Customs Clearances as the issuance of the said permits require a valid CPR. For the purposes of conducting advertising and sales promotions activities and customs-related concerns, a copy of this Circular together with a copy of the valid LTO of the HUHS establishment may be presented to government and non-government entities in lieu of a valid FDA-issued CPR.\nB. Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) of HUHS Products\nPMS shall be in accordance with FDA Circular No. 2020-025 during and after the transitory period extension. This does not preclude this Office from issuing subsequent orders it may deem necessary and appropriate, particularly on labeling to ensure consumer protection and prevent misleading claims on labeling and should there be findings of any violation of the company to the existing laws, rules, and regulations.\nC. Reiteration/Adoption of Other Provisions in FDA Circular No. 2020-025\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Responsibilities of Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) including all other clauses or parts stipulated in FDA Circular No. 2020-025 remains valid and shall be enforced.\nD. After the 2-Year Transitory Period Extension\n\nCPR shall be mandatory for all HUHS products distributed in the market.\nSales and Promo Permit shall be mandatory for all companies conducting promotional activities with participating HUHS products.\nLabels of HUHS products shall be fully compliant with Annex J of FDA Circular No. 2020-025, including the GHS Label Elements.\nAny requests for exhaustion of remaining stocks of non-compliant labels or HUHS products with non-compliant labels shall no longer be granted.\n\nV. REPEALING CLAUSE\nThis Circular hereby amends relevant provisions in FDA Circular Nos. 2020-025 and 2021-011.\nVI. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE\nThe provisions of this Circular are hereby declared separable and in the event of any such provision/s is/are declared invalid or unenforceable, the validity of enforceability of the remaining portions or provisions which are not affected, shall remain in full force and in effect.\nVII.

{"id": "REG_20776495", "data": ["Share this Post!\n\n\nI. RATIONALE\nOn 18 June 2021, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 2021-0039, entitled \u201cNational Policy on the Elimination of Industrially-Produced Trans-Fatty Acids for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases\u201d, which prohibits Industrially-Produced TFA (IP TFA) from prepackaged processed food products due to the alarming global and local magnitude of the problem involving Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD). As stated in the said DOH AO and the 2017 Non-Communicable Disease Report of the World Health Organization (WHO), about 3,000 people in the Philippines suffer yearly from premature mortality related to high consumption of TFA. Further, according to WHO in 2020, cardiovascular diseases have been the leading cause of death globally for the past three decades. The biggest killer is coronary heart disease, responsible for 16% of the world\u2019s total deaths. From 2000 to 2019, deaths from ischemic heart disease rose faster than deaths from any other disease, increasing from more than 2 million in 2000 to nearly 9 million in 2019. The said DOH AO No. 2021-0039 stated that studies have consistently suggested that there is no safe level of TFA consumption and that TFA intake has no known health benefit. Due to its effect on the body\u2019s Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), high intake of TFAs increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease and other NCD. A preliminary exposure assessment of FNRI in 2018 reported that high level consumers among children under 6 years old (95th percentile) are at risk of TFA exposure at 150% upper limit. Despite the availability of such exposure assessments, there is still a lack of a more rigorous monitoring and evaluation system to further assess the impact of TFA intake among Filipinos. With neighboring countries implementing bans on Partially-Hydrogenated Oils (PHO) and setting mandatory limits on TFA content in food, the Philippines is vulnerable to dumping of TFA-rich food products in the absence of similar regulations.\nIn accordance with the mandate of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Republic Act (RA) No. 9711 or the \u201cFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Act of 2009\u201d, RA No. 10611 or the \u201cFood Safety Act of 2013\u201d, and their respective Implementing Rules and Regulations, as well as the FDA\u2019s roles and responsibilities as stated in Section VII (D) of DOH AO No. 2021-0039, the FDA issues this Circular to: (1) provide and implement guidelines for TFA regulation in prepackaged processed food products and (2) determine the appropriate transitory period that shall not be more than two (2) years from the said AO\u2019s effectivity.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nTo provide guidelines for evaluation during product registration of prepackaged processed food products containing TFA intended to be manufactured, used, imported, distributed and offered for sale in the Philippine market.\nTo prohibit the importation, local manufacture, distribution, use and sale of PHO, and Oils and Fats blended with PHO; Oils and Fats with TFA content more than 2g per 100g/ml of total fat; and prepackaged processed food products with PHO and high TFA content exceeding 2g per 100g/ml of total fat.\nTo set additional requirements for the registration of prepackaged processed food products containing TFA, and specify the transitory period of its implementation.\n\nIII. SCOPE\nThis Circular shall cover manufacturers, traders, importers, and distributors of raw materials, ingredients and prepackaged processed food products containing TFA intended for Philippine market distribution. This Circular does not cover retailers and exporters.\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nHigh Trans Fatty Acids content \u2013 for the purpose of this Circular, shall refer to TFA content of more than 2g per 100g or 100ml of total fat prepackaged processed food products and non-alcoholic beverages in accordance with the WHO Module on Legislate or Regulate.\nIndustrially-Produced TFA (IP TFA) \u2013 refers to artificial trans fat that is developed through the partial hydrogenation of oils, as opposed to the naturally occurring trans fatty acids that are found in the fat of animal origin. Also developed in small amounts through re-heating and frying of oils at high temperatures.\nNaturally-occurring TFA \u2013 refer to trans fatty acids that are found in meat and dairy products from ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels.\n\n\nPartially Hydrogenated Oil (PHO) \u2013 refers to the processed products that contain IP TFA, which are typically used to increase shelf-life and ensure flavor stability of oils. It means oils or fats that have been hydrogenated, but not to complete or near saturation, and with an Iodine Value (IV) greater than 4, according to WHO REPLACE Action Package Module 3.\nPrepackaged \u2013 is a processed food made up in advance in a container, labeled and ready for sale to the consumer, or for catering purposes.\nProcessed Food Products \u2013 refer to food that has been subjected to some degree of processing like milling, drying, concentrating, canning, or addition of some ingredients which changes partially or completely the physico-chemical and/or sensory characteristics of the food\u2019s raw material.\n\n\nRaw Materials \u2013 refer to all substances that are employed in the processing of a finished product, packed in bulk containers, and not labelled as finished product. Raw Materials or ingredients would have product specifications that comply with the client requirements and not necessarily a single document.\nTrans\u2013Fatty Acids \u2013 refer to the fatty acids with at least a double bond in the trans configuration, regardless of whether they are produced industrially or come from ruminant sources, including linoleic acid.\nTFA-Free Claim \u2013 refers to any claim that states or suggests that the processed food product does not contain TFA. This includes claims as \u201cTrans Fat Free\u201d, with \u201c0 g Trans Fat \u201d, or any other similar claim.\n\nV. GENERAL GUIDELINES \nA. Prepackaged processed food products for human consumption, commercial sale or use shall not contain PHO whether as a single ingredient or raw material, or as an ingredient to any prepackaged processed food product. Similarly, the manufacture, trading, importation and distribution in the Philippine market of these products are prohibited in accordance with the DOH AO No. 2021-0039 and this Circular.\nB.
